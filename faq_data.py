        "question": "What is artificial intelligence?",
        "answer": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It enables computers to perform tasks like reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and understanding language."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is machine learning?",
        "answer": "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where algorithms learn patterns from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is deep learning?",
        "answer": "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence 'deep') to learn complex patterns, especially in images, audio, and text."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a neural network?",
        "answer": "A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process data and learn to make predictions."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is natural language processing?",
        "answer": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, both written and spoken."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is computer vision?",
        "answer": "Computer Vision is a field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand visual data from the world, such as images and videos."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between AI and machine learning?",
        "answer": "AI is the broad concept of machines simulating human intelligence. Machine Learning is a specific approach to achieving AI, where models learn from data rather than following hardcoded rules."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is supervised learning?",
        "answer": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data — meaning each input has a known correct output — so it can learn to predict outputs for new inputs."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is unsupervised learning?",
        "answer": "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data and must find hidden patterns or groupings on its own, such as clustering."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is reinforcement learning?",
        "answer": "Reinforcement Learning is a type of ML where an agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards for correct actions and penalties for incorrect ones, like training a game-playing AI."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a large language model?",
        "answer": "A Large Language Model (LLM) is a deep learning model trained on massive amounts of text data. It can generate, summarize, translate, and understand human language. Examples include GPT and Claude."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
        "answer": "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on new unseen data. It means the model memorized rather than generalized."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a training dataset?",
        "answer": "A training dataset is the collection of data used to teach a machine learning model. The model finds patterns in this data to make predictions later."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are some real world applications of AI?",
        "answer": "AI is used in many areas including healthcare (disease diagnosis), finance (fraud detection), transportation (self-driving cars), entertainment (recommendations), and customer service (chatbots)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a chatbot?",
        "answer": "A chatbot is an AI-powered program designed to simulate conversation with humans. It can answer questions, provide support, and perform tasks through text or voice interaction."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is transfer learning?",
        "answer": "Transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is reused and fine-tuned for a different but related task, saving time and requiring less data."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a generative AI?",
        "answer": "Generative AI refers to AI systems that can create new content — such as text, images, music, or video — based on patterns learned from existing data. Examples include ChatGPT and DALL·E."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is bias in AI?",
        "answer": "AI bias occurs when a model produces unfair or skewed results due to biased training data or flawed design. It can lead to discrimination in areas like hiring, lending, or facial recognition."
    },
    {
        "question": "What programming languages are used in AI?",
        "answer": "Python is the most popular language for AI and ML due to its rich libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn). Other languages used include R, Julia, and Java."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is TensorFlow?",
        "answer": "TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It is widely used for building and training deep learning models."
